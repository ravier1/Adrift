About This Project

This project started as a personal passion project born out of frustration ðŸ˜¤. I was fed up with Twitchâ€”especially the low bitrate and clunky experience on Firefox, not to mention the disorganized multi-streamer layouts. YouTube, on the other hand, delivered a superior streaming quality with better bitrate, inspiring me to create a tool that brings the best of both worlds together. I wanted a seamless, high-quality viewing experience with the energetic vibe of Twitch chat. And thus, Adrift Video Player was born! ðŸš€ðŸ’»
